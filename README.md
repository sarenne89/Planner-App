# Planner-App

Week 7 Challenge - Third Party APIs

## Description

In this weeks challenge, we have been tasked with creating a daily planner app that includes the current date and various different time slots. These time slots can have data enterred in them, which can be saved and later retrieved on page refresh. The time slots will also change their styling depending on the time of day to give some visual cues to the user.
This challenge includes use of Bootstrap, JQuery and dayjs().
